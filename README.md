# Improving data collection systems and analysis of ICCAT fisheries in the wider Caribbean 
# - Phase 1 -
This project proposes to help the SCRS identify the most productive activities that can improve the reporting 
of catches and other fishery data from the Caribbean region. This pilot project proposes a series of activities 
to help define the scope for a more comprehensive set of future actions.  Five activities are proposed, the first 
three focus on ICCAT CPC members, and activities one and two use current information available in ICCAT databases 
or provided by countries in recent capacity-building workshops.  

Activity four expands the information sources beyond ICCAT and considers countries that are not CPCs.  The fifth 
and final activity develops a digital repository of all documents and information identified in the first four 
activities. This website is design to provide access to the mentioned digital repository.

# Countries considered for the analysis


# Species of interest
Yellofin tuna (*Thunnus albacares*) and blue marlin (*Makaira nigricans*) are the species of interest for the project, 
however the repository is not limited to those two species, as it also includes other species of interest for ICCAT.

# How to access the repositories
This repository can be access in two ways:
By checking on this website the list of references, databases and websites (which includes links for direct access), 
or by opening the Google Sheets document [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zdjk6D-FWdcXfw-etrk46iC5y6dBT4MA88TSz4rz8nk/edit?usp=sharing) which has a list of all the files, websites and databases of the project repository.
For the Google Sheet file, you could read the tutorial (Manual) available here: Manual for users.
